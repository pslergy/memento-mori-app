# Funding & Support

Memento Mori is an independent, open source research project. It is developed by a solo developer and relies on grants, sponsorships, and community support.

## 🧪 NLnet Foundation (Open Call 2026)

**Status:** Application submitted — under review  
**Application code:** `2026-04-071`  
**Amount requested:** €34,000  
**Focus:** Cross-device validation, acoustic transport optimization, security hardening

We have applied for funding from the [NLnet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl) as part of their Open Call (April 2026). NLnet supports open source projects that strengthen the open internet and digital rights. If approved, these funds will be used to:

- Test the Sonar (ultrasonic) transport on **30+ Android devices** (Huawei, Xiaomi, MediaTek, etc.)
- Optimize the Goertzel algorithm for low-end hardware
- Finalize the **Double Ratchet** implementation for forward secrecy
- Harden the **Decoy Mode** and **Panic Wipe** mechanisms
- Improve documentation and release a public beta

We expect a decision in mid-2026.

## 🌱 Open Collective (pending)

We have applied to join [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com) as a fiscal host for transparent, community-driven funding. Once approved, this page will allow individuals and organizations to sponsor Memento Mori directly.

We are also working on setting up alternative donation platforms (GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, etc.). Updates will be posted here and in the repository.

## 💙 How to help right now

Even without a formal funding platform, you can support Memento Mori in several ways:

- **Test the app** on your Android device — especially if you have a **Huawei, Xiaomi, or MediaTek** model.  
  ⚠️ Note: The core protocol logic (gossip, FSM, decoy mode) is not included in the public repository for security reasons. Testing is currently limited to UI, transport interfaces, and non-core functionality. If you are a security researcher or experienced contributor interested in core access, please open an issue describing your background.

- **Report bugs** or unexpected behavior via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pslergy/memento-mori-app/issues)

- **Contribute code** — see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for areas where help is welcome (UI, documentation, device testing, DSP optimization)

- **Spread the word** — share the project with anyone who might need offline, censorship-resistant communication
