## 🧪 NLnet Foundation (Open Call 2026)

**Status:** Application submitted — under review  
**Application code:** `2026-04-071`  
**Amount requested:** €34,000  
**Focus:** Cross-device validation, acoustic transport optimization, security hardening

We have applied for funding from the [NLnet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl) as part of their Open Call (April 2026). NLnet supports open source projects that strengthen the open internet and digital rights. If approved, these funds will be used to:

- Test the Sonar (ultrasonic) transport on 30+ Android devices (Huawei, Xiaomi, MediaTek, etc.)
- Optimize the Goertzel algorithm for low-end hardware
- Finalize the Double Ratchet implementation for forward secrecy
- Harden the Decoy Mode and Panic Wipe mechanisms
- Improve documentation and release a public beta

We expect a decision in mid-2026.
