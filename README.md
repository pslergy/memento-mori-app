## ⚠️ RESEARCH PREVIEW (ALPHA)

> **Memento Mori is currently under active engineering development.**  
> The protocol implementation and routing logic are designed for research of **Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTN)**.  
> While the core transport layer is functional, this software is **not recommended for mission-critical use** without independent validation.

---

## 💀 The Mission

**Memento Mori** is a fault-tolerant autonomous mesh infrastructure designed to operate under **total network degradation**.

The project implements a shadow communication layer beneath the traditional Internet, leveraging:

- Acoustic signaling  
- Radio-based discovery  
- Opportunistic cloud gateways  

It is built for environments where connectivity is intermittent, hostile, monitored, or deliberately suppressed.

## 🧠 Core Engineering Innovations

### 1️⃣ Advanced Hardware Interlock (Android Fragmentation Solution)

Standard Android APIs often fail on fragmented hardware (Huawei, Xiaomi, Samsung) due to aggressive battery optimization.

Memento Mori implements a custom **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**:

- **Vendor-Specific Strategies**  
  Reverse-engineered BLE behavior to bypass background restrictions on Huawei/Honor devices.  
  Uses inverted logic (Passive Peripheral vs Active Central).

- **Finite State Machine (FSM)**  
  Deterministic Bluetooth/Wi-Fi management preventing GATT 133 deadlocks.

- **Biological Burst-Mode**  
  Nodes synchronize wake cycles and exchange data in short bursts — reducing battery usage by up to **90%**.

---

### 2️⃣ Multi-Layer Hybrid Transport

- 🦇 **Acoustic Sonar (L2)**  
  Ultrasonic BFSK modulation (18–20 kHz) using Goertzel detection.

- 📡 **BLE Control Plane**  
  Zero-connect topology inference via advertising packets.

- ⚡ **Wi-Fi Direct (Data Plane)**  
  Automatic high-bandwidth escalation after BLE verification.

---

### 3️⃣ Distributed Consistency (DTN)

- **Store-and-Forward Architecture** — encrypted local Outbox  
- **Gossip Protocol** — epidemic propagation  
- **CRDTs** — convergence guarantee during partitions  

---

### 4️⃣ High-Grade Security (Decoy & Panic)

- **Decoy Mode**  
  Dual-password architecture:
  - Real Vault  
  - Decoy Vault (identical UI)

- **Panic Wipe**  
  Shake-to-Kill instantly erases keys and logs.

- **Ghost Identity**  
  Offline Ed25519 identities stored in encrypted SQLite (WAL mode).
