# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Memento Mori is a research-oriented project focused on resilient and privacy-preserving communication.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it responsibly by:
- Opening a private security advisory on GitHub, or
- Contacting the maintainer directly via GitHub profile

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will make a best-effort attempt to respond in a timely manner.
